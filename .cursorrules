This is a React project using Shadcn, Recoil, and Radix UI. It is a web app that allows you to quickly sort your Spotify songs into playlists. Use Shadcn components when possible and just indicate which ones you used by providing the npm install command. It should look like npx shadcn@latest add [component] (NOT shadcn-ui@latest).
