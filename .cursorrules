This is a React project using Shadcn, Recoil, and Radix UI. It is just a client side web app for now. It is a web app that allows you to quickly sort your Spotify songs into playlists. Use Shadcn components when possible and just indicate which ones you used by providing the npm install command. It should look like bunx shadcn@latest add [component] (NOT shadcn-ui@latest).
